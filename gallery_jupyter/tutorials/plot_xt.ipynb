        "\n# Expected threat\n\nThis example shows how to create an expected threat (xT) model. Expected threat is a method\nfor valuing the likelihood of scoring with possession of the ball at\na position on the football pitch.\n\nExpected threat is based on `Markov chains <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain>`_.\nThe main assumption for modelling soccer in this way is the probability of scoring\nonly depends on the current action, it is memoryless, and it does not consider what\nhappened before or after the event. Often in soccer, this isn't a fair assumption as attacks\nmay form quickly on the counter or due to pressuring the opponent high up the field. In\nreality how an action came about and how the defence is shifted\nmay have an impact on what happens next.\n\nI recommend reading through this excellent\n`blog post <https://soccermatics.medium.com/explaining-expected-threat-cbc775d97935>`_ by\n`David Sumpter (@soccermatics) <https://twitter.com/Soccermatics>`_ on the history of expected\nthreat, its limitations, and possible extensions.\n\nThe first use of Markov chains to evaluate the probability of scoring was by\n`Sarah Rudd <https://twitter.com/srudd_ok>`_ in their\n`conference presentation <http://nessis.org/nessis11/rudd.pdf>`_ \"a framework for tactical\nanalysis and individual offensive production assessment in soccer using Markov chains.\" Although\nnot named expected threat it contained many of the ideas used here.\n`Karun Singh <https://twitter.com/karun1710>`_ then popularised and named the idea\nin their `fantastic interactive blog post <https://karun.in/blog/expected-threat.html>`_. In this\ntutorial, we model expected threat using Karun's ideas in the blog post.\n"
